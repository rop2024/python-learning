# Zoo Management System:
# Create an Animal class with attributes like species, age, and diet type.
# Subclasses such as Mammal, Bird, and Reptile should inherit
# from Animal, each with specific attributes
# (e.g., Mammal might have fur color).
# Create a Zoo class to manage and display animals based on their diet and type.
