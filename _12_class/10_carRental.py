# Vehicle Rental System:
# Create a Vehicle class with attributes like make, model, and rental price.
# Subclasses like Car and Bike should inherit from Vehicle and add specific attributes
# (e.g., Car might have a seating capacity).
# Implement a method to rent a vehicle that reduces its availability.
